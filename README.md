# MieWeb Project - Mie Calculation Interactive Tool

## Description

MieWeb is an interactive tool designed to compare the electromagnetic scattering response of different materials using Mie theory. It allows users to graphically visualize the absorption and scattering properties of optical materials, making it easier to compare their characteristics without requiring programming knowledge.


## Requirements

- python==3.12
- requirements.txt


## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository and navigate into mieWeb

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergiiosalas/tfg.git
```

Then, navigate into the mieWeb directory where the application code is located:
```bash
cd tfg/mieWeb
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create and activate it using:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```


### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 4. Run the app

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```
